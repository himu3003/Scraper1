# Delhi Courts â€” Cause List Downloader (Streamlit)

A small Streamlit app that fetches and downloads **all judge cause list PDFs** from the Delhi District Courts "Daily Board" page in real time.

## What it does
- Given a date (user input), the app scrapes:

- Finds all judge-specific PDF links related to that date.
- Downloads each PDF into `output/cause_lists/` (optionally grouped by date).
- Optionally creates a ZIP for easier download.

## How to run (locally)
